      <p class="clearfix"><img src="images/keith_pic.jpeg" alt="Keith Profile Picture" height="120" > I'm driven by a deep desire to make a difference. During the day I play a super hero as an Enjoy Expert helping people remove the frustration from technology but at night I study computer science part time and practice coding in Ruby, C, Java, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, JQuery, Bootstrap framework and a-dab-a-database. From CMS platforms like Joomla, Drupal, and Wordpress to eCommerce and analytics software like Bigcommerce and Google Analytics, my wide range of experience running a web development and marketing company is somewhat unique. I value family, personal growth, and education deeply. </p>
      <p>My work history is in entrepreneurship (built a thriving business by delivering digital products and building scalable websites that convert visitors to subscribers and buyers) and electronics/computer troubleshooting (as a Senior Advisor at Apple Inc). Through founding a start-up, I've gained valuable experience in process experimentation, managing projects, developing people, and finding efficient solutions to unique problems.</p>
